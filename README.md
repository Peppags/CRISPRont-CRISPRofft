# CRISPR-ONT & CRISPR-OFFT

## Overview
CRISPR-ONT and CRISPR-OFFT are attention-based convolution neural networks (CNNs) frameworks to accurately predict CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA on- and off-target activities, respectively. By integrating CNNs with attention mechanism, both CRISPR-ONT and CRISPR-OFFT are able to capture the intrinsic characteristics of Cas9-sgRNA binding and cleavage, thus improving the accuracy and interpretability.
